Based on the requirements for a modular, scalable, and maintainable frontend architecture for a Sudoku game application, here is the proposed folder structure and file descriptions:

```
Path: /src/index.html
# Entry file which sets up the HTML structure and links CSS and JS assets for the Sudoku page.

Path: /src/index.js
# Main Javascript file which handles the initiation of the React app and ReactDOM rendering.

Path: /src/App.jsx
# Main React component acting as the root for the Sudoku game application.

Path: /src/components/Grid.jsx
# Defines the interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid component that renders individual Cells and handles their interactions.

Path: /src/components/Cell.jsx
# Represents a single cell in the Sudoku grid, handling value changes and user interactions.

Path: /src/components/Button.jsx
# Reusable button component for actions like "New Game" or "Check", with customizable properties like onClick action and text.

Path: /src/hooks/useSudokuSolver.js
# Custom React hook that provides logic for solving the Sudoku puzzle using backtracking method.

Path: /src/utils/sudokuGenerator.js
# Utility to randomly generate a valid Sudoku grid. Used by the game to set initial state.

Path: /src/styles/main.css
# Main styling file where base styles, including the primary background and layout configurations, are defined.

Path: /src/styles/grid.css
# Specific styles for the Sudoku grid component, focusing on alignment, cell design and responsive behaviors.

Path: /src/services/leaderboardService.js
# Service handling communications with backend for retrieving and updating leaderboard scores.

Path: /src/assets/icons/sudoku-icon.svg
# Icon graphic used in the application header or for branding purposes.

Path: /public/favicon.ico
# The favicon for the web application, typically displayed in the browser tab.

Path: /public/manifest.json
# Contains metadata used on mobile devices when saving the app to the home screen as a Progressive Web App.

Path: /src/components/Header.jsx
# Header component displayed across the top of the application, possibly containing navigation and logo.
```
This structure emphasizes separation of concerns (separating utilities, components, hooks, and services) and enforce modularity and scalability. Components like Button and Cell are designed to be reusable and independent. The use of hooks like useSudokuSolver encapsulates specific business logic which can improve maintainability and reduce complexity in the UI components.
